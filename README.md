## Welcome to QuantumLang

Quantum mechanics is the key for us to explore the nature of microscopic world. With greatly enhanced computation
hardware and gradually matured quantum simulation softwares, we are capable of simulating hundreds and thousands of atoms within
a reasonably amount of time. Among all these simulations, a large number of them is devoted to study ground state properties of
a quantum system, e.g. bonding energy and equilibrium geometry of a given molecule. 

With the advent of deep learning these days, a trend to use fully variational method has emerged in various fields. Since variational
principle is embeded in quantum mechanics, we would like to utilize it's power in computation. QuantumLang is designed for this, it
implememnts a framework that allows you to write quantum mechanics code that can be differentiate by the state of the art automatic
differentiation engine, thus, evaluating gradients no longer takes your time.
